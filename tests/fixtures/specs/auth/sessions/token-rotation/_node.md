## Statement
When an access token is within 60 s of expiry, the auth service shall issue a new token and revoke the old one.

## Scenarios
### Near-expiry token is refreshed
- Given a session whose token expires in 30 s
- When the client calls refresh
- Then a new token pair is returned
- And the old refresh token is rejected

## Verify
- `python -m unittest tests.test_rotate`

## Rationale
Short-lived tokens limit the damage of a leaked token.
